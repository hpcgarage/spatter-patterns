# Georgia Tech Spatter Patterns

Authors: Patrick Lavin, Rich Vuduc, Jeffrey Young

These patterns are included in the Spatter benchmark repo in the folder `standard-suite/` but are included here as an example for other contributors.

## Patterns

- `basic-tests/`: Simple uniform stride and STREAM-like patterns used for testing Spatter and generating easily interpretable results.
- `app-traces/`: The patterns were derived from simulations on a proprietary simulator of an Arm processor with 1024-bit SVE registers.
